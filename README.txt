README

This git repository contains files, which are useful in addition to 
tiled-qt (see mapeditor.org or https://github.com/bjorn/tiled)

The files in this repository are only needed for special purposes,
so it does not make sense to have it in the main repository.
To add the files to the main repository, just copy over the needed files.

Purpose/List of files:

======== Daily builds on the Windows platform ========
./README_dailys.txt
./autobuild.sh
./dist/win/setandbuild32.bat

See ./README_dailys.txt for instructions.


======== Measuring code speed ========
./src/tiled/durationlogger.h
